# Gen AI Based Field Workforce Safety Assistant

## Architecture Overview

This solution provides a safety assistant for field workforce personnel, leveraging generative AI to help workers assess and mitigate safety risks in industrial environments.

### Backend

The backend is built using AWS services including:
- Amazon Bedrock for foundation models
- Amazon Bedrock Agents for orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- AWS Lambda for serverless compute
- Amazon DynamoDB for data storage
- Amazon API Gateway for REST API endpoints
- Amazon Cognito for authentication

## Deployment

You can deploy this solution using either AWS CDK directly or via CloudFormation.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Configure AWS credentials in your environment
- Download and install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models (Claude 3 Sonnet recommended)
- OpenWeather API key for weather data integration
- Enable required models in the Amazon Bedrock console (https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess). You may need to request access if not already granted.

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Deploy using CloudFormation

1. Download the CloudFormation template from the `cfn-templates` directory
2. Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console
3. Create a new stack using the template
4. Provide the required parameters:
   - CollaboratorFoundationModel: Foundation model for the collaborator agent (default: anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0)
   - SupervisorFoundationModel: Foundation model for the supervisor agent (default: anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0)
   - OpenWeatherApiKey: Your OpenWeather API key (required)
5. Wait for the stack to complete deployment (this may take 15-20 minutes)

The CloudFormation template will:
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Bootstrap the CDK environment
- Deploy all required resources using CDK

#### Option 2: Deploy using CDK directly

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd cdk
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
You should see (.venv) at the beginning of your command prompt.

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Log in to the AWS ECR Public registry. This is needed to download docker images for builds.
```bash
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws
```

4. If this is the first time using CDK in this account and region, bootstrap CDK. This is a one-time setup that provisions resources CDK needs to deploy your stacks.
```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

5. Deploy the stacks with required parameters:
```bash    
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never --context openweather_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY" --context collaborator_foundation_model="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0" --context supervisor_foundation_model="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
```

For convenience in future deployments, you may choose to persist the context values in `cdk.json`:
```json
{
  "app": "python3 app.py",
  "context": {
    "openweather_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "collaborator_foundation_model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    "supervisor_foundation_model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
  }
}
```

## Clean Up
To avoid further charges, follow the tear down procedure:

1. If you deployed using CloudFormation, delete the CloudFormation stack from the AWS console.

2. If you deployed using CDK directly, destroy the stacks:
```bash
cdk destroy --all
```

For a comprehensive list of arguments and options, consult the [CDK CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html).
